        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m a tinkerer who likes to open things up and see how they work. I'm interested in the design part of websites. I guess that means I am interested in the front-end development. I have had a fun-filled and exciting career and traveled extensively. I've been fortunate to meet and work with people from different backgrounds and nationalities. I'm excited to learn about web design. </p>
        <p>I've spent plenty of time on computers throughout my career. However, not on the design or coding piece.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to learn how to do both front-end development and eventually back-end web development. However, I'll stick with buidling knowledge and expertise in the former for now. I want to have fun with the process. I do believe one should enjoy the journey. I'll focus on:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>       
        </ul>

        <p>I do foresee learning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>java</li>
          <li>python</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, I am patient. I don't want to get ahead of myself. I am uncertain how I want to employ these new skills. I'll figure it out...:)</p>
